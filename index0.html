  <h1>RichCall.</h1>
  <h2>Seamless integration with contact center software and IP PBX</h2>
  <h3 id="STATUS">...</h3>
  <p>RichCall is not just another "browser-to-browser video chat". It does not simply connect website visitors with video chat channel agents, though it can do it as well.</p>

<p>Instead, RichCall leverages your existing contact center operations, workflows and apps to:</p>

<ul>
<li>route and queue video chat requests,
<li>handle video chat interactions,
<li>measure customer satisfaction and agent performance.
</ul>

<p>Only by integrating closely with the contact center software can unique business benefits be obtained:</p>

<ul>
<li>BLENDED AGENTS - your agents receive both phone calls and video chat sessions, all distributed by the same contact center app,
<li>OMNI-CHANNEL COMPLIANCE - the video chat sessions are supplemented with contextual data which allows to identify the customer,
<li>UNIFIED TOOLS - for recording, reporting, WFM/WFO.
</ul>

<h2>Web-collaboration powered by WebRTC and in-house expertise</h2>

<p>RichCall leverages WebRTC technologies to provide high quality communications supported by real-time network adjustments, without the need for plugins.</p>

<p>The built-in STUN/TURN-servers allow RichCall to easily cope with NAT and firewalls.</p>

<p>Combined with in-house developed features such as video-conferencing, interaction recording and content-sharing (co-browsing, text chat, app sharing, snipping tool and more), RichCall offers your customers an unforgettable web-collaboration experience.</p>

<p>With RichCall, your customers can interact with you using:</p>

<ul>
<li>desktop and mobile browsers,
<li>iOS and Android apps,
